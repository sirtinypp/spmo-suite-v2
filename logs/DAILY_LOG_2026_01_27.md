## 🚀 Today's Progress

### 🛒 SUPLAY App Restoration
*   **Transactions Page Fixed:** Resolved a critical `TemplateSyntaxError` caused by missing spaces around `==` operators in Django template tags.
*   **Automated Audit:** Executed a Python-based syntax fixer (`fix_templates.py`) to standardize all HTML templates across the SUPLAY application.
*   **Feature Rejection:** Strategically removed the "Notification Badge" feature to eliminate runtime context overhead and ensure absolute system stability.
*   **Currency Standardization:** Maintained standardized price displays using ₱, `floatformat:2`, and `intcomma`.
*   **Session Timeout Logic:** Corrected the auto-logout path from `/accounts/logout/` to `/logout/`.

### 📦 GAMIT Refinements
*   **Checkpoint v1.2.0-stable:** Finalized session timeout fixes and UI consistency updates.

### 🛠️ General Infrastructure & Orchestration
*   **JARVIS Checkpoint:** Orchestrated a formal production-grade backup (`v1.2.0-production`).
*   **Version Control:** Synchronized internal versioning references and updated the `VERSION` file.
