# Daily Log: January 16, 2026

**Status:** Green (Codebase Stable) / Yellow (Deployment Pending)
**Focus:** News Archive Module & SSPMO Branding

## 1. Achievements
*   [x] **News Archive Module (v1.1.0):**
    *   Fully rebuilt from scratch to match `index.html` design patterns.
    *   Functional Search, Category, and Year filters.
    *   Deployed to `172.20.3.91` and verified live at `http://sspmo.up.edu.ph/news/archive/`.
*   [x] **SSPMO Branding:**
    *   Complete overhaul of Home, Login, and Base templates to "Government Digital Standard".
    *   Updated "About Us" and Footer content.
*   [x] **Infrastructure:**
    *   Domain migration to `*.sspmo.up.edu.ph`.
    *   Resolved persistent `TemplateSyntaxError` via Python build script.

## 2. Issues / Blockers
*   **Git Push Rejected:** The push to `origin main` was declined by the remote server, likely due to file size limits ("Large File Storage").
    *   *Error:* `pre-receive hook declined`
    *   *Impact:* Local commits (v1.1.0) are saved, but not synced to GitHub.
    *   *Action Required:* Need to investigate large files (likely images/db) and potentially use Git LFS.

## 3. Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1.  **Resolve Git Push:** Install Git LFS or exclude large static assets from the repo.
2.  **Resume Task List:**
    *   "Bulk Import Verification" (Item 1).
    *   "Reverse Proxy Implementation" (Item 10).
    *   "SPMO Hub Layout Restructure" (Phase 2).

## 4. Current Environment State
*   **Local:** `c:\Users\Aaron\spmo-suite - Copy` (Clean, v1.1.0 tagged).
*   **Remote:** `172.20.3.91` (Running `news_archive.html` manually deployed).
